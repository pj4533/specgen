Below is a comprehensive plan to implement the `specgen` CLI application from your specification. First, you’ll see a high-level blueprint of the project. After that, the plan is broken down into smaller and smaller chunks until each step is approachable and ensures incremental progress without leaving any unused or “orphaned” code. Finally, you’ll see a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM to implement everything step by step, building on prior outputs, culminating in a complete solution.

---

# High-Level Blueprint

1. **Initialize the Swift Package**  
   - Use `swift package init --type executable` to create the basic package structure.  
   - Set up `main.swift` as the entry point.

2. **Add Argument Parsing**  
   - Add `ArgumentParser` as a dependency in `Package.swift`.  
   - Create a command struct (e.g., `SpecGenCommand`) that parses flags such as `--verbose`.

3. **Environment and API Key Handling**  
   - Check the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.  
   - If absent, attempt to parse a local `.env` file (manually) for the key.  
   - If key not found, show an error and exit.

4. **Networking Layer**  
   - Implement a lightweight `OpenAIService` that uses `URLSession` (with async/await) to call the OpenAI GPT-4o API.  
   - Handle request creation, response parsing, and errors.

5. **User Interface / ANSI Output**  
   - Implement a simple set of helper functions or a small `ConsoleUI` struct to:  
     - Print colored/emojified messages.  
     - Show spinners and overwrite them when completed.

6. **Main Interaction Loop**  
   - Prompt for user input.  
   - Send an initial prompt to GPT-4o.  
   - Display the LLM’s question.  
   - Prompt the user for an answer.  
   - Repeat until user enters `/finish`.

7. **Generate Final Specification**  
   - On `/finish`, send a summarizing prompt to GPT-4o.  
   - Capture the response.  
   - Write it to a file named `spec-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md`.  
   - Print success message and exit.

8. **Verbose Logging**  
   - Use `OSLog` for logging at different levels.  
   - Toggle extra log output when `--verbose` is present.

9. **Error Handling**  
   - Gracefully handle networking errors, parse failures, and missing API keys.  
   - Show retry prompts when needed.

# Breakdown into Iterative Chunks (Round 1)

Here’s the same plan divided into more granular tasks. Each chunk builds on the previous one.

1. **Project Setup**  
   1. Create a new Swift executable package.  
   2. Initialize `git` (optional but recommended).  
   3. Verify that the package structure is correct and runs a “Hello, world!” program.

2. **Argument Parsing**  
   1. Add `ArgumentParser` dependency to `Package.swift`.  
   2. Create a `SpecGenCommand` struct conforming to `ParsableCommand`.  
   3. Support a `--verbose` flag.  
   4. Make the command the entry point in `main.swift`.

3. **Logging**  
   1. Configure a minimal `OSLog` instance.  
   2. Use log levels to differentiate normal output from verbose logging.  
   3. Demonstrate by printing logs in `main.swift`.

4. **Environment Key Management**  
   1. Check for `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment.  
   2. If not found, parse local `.env`.  
   3. If still not found, show an error and exit.

5. **Networking Layer**  
   1. Create an `OpenAIService` struct that contains the logic for calling GPT-4o.  
   2. Implement request creation with `URLSession` (async/await).  
   3. Parse the JSON response from GPT-4o into a Swift model.  
   4. Handle network errors with retries (or at least a descriptive message).

6. **User Interface**  
   1. Write functions to print colored or emoji-enhanced messages (e.g., `printColored(_:style:)`).  
   2. Implement a “spinner” that overwrites itself until the operation completes.  
   3. Ensure these helpers are tested or at least verified manually.

7. **Main Interaction Loop**  
   1. Welcome the user with ANSI colors and emojis.  
   2. Prompt for their idea.  
   3. Send an initial message to GPT-4o.  
   4. Display GPT-4o’s question, prompt user for an answer.  
   5. Continue until user types `/finish`.

8. **Final Spec Generation**  
   1. On `/finish`, send final summarizing prompt.  
   2. Capture the response.  
   3. Write it out to a timestamped `spec-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.md` file.  
   4. Confirm success to user and exit.

# Breakdown into Even Smaller Steps (Round 2)

We can refine each chunk further to ensure minimal risk and easy debugging. Below is an even more step-by-step approach.

1. **Project Setup**  
   1.1. `swift package init --type executable --name specgen`  
   1.2. Confirm `Package.swift`, `Sources/specgen/main.swift`, and `Tests/specgenTests` are created.  
   1.3. `swift build` and `swift run` (make sure “Hello, world!” prints).

2. **Argument Parsing**  
   2.1. Add `.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser", from: "1.2.0")` in `Package.swift` dependencies.  
   2.2. Add `.product(name: "ArgumentParser", package: "swift-argument-parser")` to `targets[.executableTarget].dependencies`.  
   2.3. Create `SpecGenCommand.swift` in `Sources/specgen/`.  
   2.4. Import `ArgumentParser`, define `SpecGenCommand : ParsableCommand`.  
   2.5. Add `@Flag var verbose: Bool` property.  
   2.6. Implement a `run()` that prints a message.  
   2.7. Update `main.swift` to call `SpecGenCommand.main()`.

3. **Logging**  
   3.1. Import `os` in a new file `Logger.swift`.  
   3.2. Define an `OSLog` category, e.g. `let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.example.specgen", category: "main")`.  
   3.3. Add a function `verboseLog(_ message: String, isVerbose: Bool)` that only logs if `isVerbose`.  
   3.4. Test by logging a simple statement when the app starts.

4. **Environment Key Management**  
   4.1. In a new file `Environment.swift`, create a function `func getApiKey() -> String?`.  
   4.2. Check `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["OPENAI_API_KEY"]`.  
   4.3. If not found, read a local `.env` (e.g., line by line, split by `=`).  
   4.4. If the key is not found, return `nil`.  
   4.5. In `SpecGenCommand.run()`, if `getApiKey()` returns `nil`, print an error and exit.

5. **Networking Layer**  
   5.1. Create `OpenAIService.swift` with a struct `OpenAIService(apiKey: String)`.  
   5.2. Add a function `sendMessage(_ text: String) async throws -> String` that uses `URLSession.data(for:)`.  
   5.3. Construct the JSON payload for GPT-4o.  
   5.4. Decode the response to extract GPT’s text.  
   5.5. Handle errors (throw descriptive Swift errors if something fails).

6. **User Interface**  
   6.1. Create `ConsoleUI.swift` with helper methods:
       - `printWithColor(_ message: String, colorCode: String)` for ANSI colors.  
       - `printEmoji(_ message: String, emoji: String)` for emojis.  
   6.2. Create a `Spinner` class or struct that starts spinning in a background thread (or uses Timer) to update the console.  
   6.3. Confirm it overwrites itself and stops on completion.

7. **Main Interaction Loop**  
   7.1. In `SpecGenCommand.run()`, print a welcome message.  
   7.2. Prompt: “Enter your idea: >”  
   7.3. Read user input using `readLine()`.  
   7.4. Call `OpenAIService.sendMessage()` with the initial meta-prompt.  
   7.5. Show the spinner while waiting.  
   7.6. When GPT responds, print the question, then prompt user to type an answer.  
   7.7. Keep sending user answers to GPT until `/finish`.

8. **Final Spec Generation**  
   8.1. If user enters `/finish`, send the summarizing prompt.  
   8.2. Print a special spinner or message while waiting.  
   8.3. On success, build a filename with a date-time stamp, e.g. `spec-20250305-154513.md`.  
   8.4. Write the GPT output to that file.  
   8.5. Print a success message and call `Darwin.exit(0)` or return from `run()`.

# Evaluation of Step Size

Each step above is small enough that you can test and verify before moving on, yet large enough that you make real progress with each iteration. Now we’ll present final code-generation prompts, one per major step, that reference and build on each other. These are designed for a code-generation LLM to produce the entire solution piece by piece, ensuring nothing is orphaned.

---

# Final Code-Generation Prompts

Below, each prompt is in a separate markdown block and labeled as text. You would provide each prompt to your code-generation LLM in sequence. After receiving each response (the generated code), you integrate it into your local project, verify, test, and then move on to the next prompt.

**Prompt 1: Project Setup**

```text
You are a coding assistant that generates Swift code.

**Goal**: Initialize a Swift Package for the `specgen` CLI tool. We'll set up a simple “Hello, world!” to ensure the package runs.

**Instructions**:
1. Create a new Swift package named `specgen` with `swift package init --type executable --name specgen`.
2. Show me what the resulting `Package.swift` and `main.swift` files might look like by default.
3. Verify `swift build` and `swift run` would compile and run, printing “Hello, world!”.

Please provide the updated `Package.swift` and `Sources/specgen/main.swift`.
```

**Prompt 2: Add Argument Parsing**

```text
We have a working Swift package named `specgen` with a basic `main.swift`. Now, integrate the Swift ArgumentParser as follows:

1. Add a `.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser", from: "1.2.0")` to the dependencies in `Package.swift`.
2. Add `.product(name: "ArgumentParser", package: "swift-argument-parser")` as a dependency for the executable target.
3. Create a new file `SpecGenCommand.swift` in `Sources/specgen/` where we define:
   ```swift
   import ArgumentParser

   struct SpecGenCommand: ParsableCommand {
       @Flag(name: .shortAndLong, help: "Show verbose logging")
       var verbose = false

       func run() throws {
           print("Argument parsing works! Verbose? \\(verbose)")
       }
   }
   ```
4. Update `main.swift` to call `SpecGenCommand.main()` instead of printing “Hello, world!”.

Show me the complete updated files:
- `Package.swift`
- `Sources/specgen/SpecGenCommand.swift`
- `Sources/specgen/main.swift`
```

**Prompt 3: Logging with OSLog**

```text
We have argument parsing working. Next, let's add logging with `OSLog`.

1. Create a file `Logger.swift` in `Sources/specgen/` with:
   - `import os`
   - A global `let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.example.specgen", category: "main")`
   - A function `verboseLog(_ message: String, isVerbose: Bool)` that uses `logger.log(level: .debug, "\(message)")` only if `isVerbose` is true.
2. In `SpecGenCommand.run()`, demonstrate calling `verboseLog("SpecGen started!", isVerbose: verbose)` to confirm it works. 
3. Show me the updated files:
   - `Logger.swift`
   - `SpecGenCommand.swift` (with the updated run method)
```

**Prompt 4: Environment Key Management**

```text
Now we want to manage the OpenAI API key. We'll look for `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment; if not found, we'll parse a local `.env` file.

1. Create `Environment.swift` in `Sources/specgen/` with a function `getApiKey() -> String?`:
   - It checks `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["OPENAI_API_KEY"]`.
   - If nil, parse a `.env` file (line by line, splitting on `=`). If a line starts with `OPENAI_API_KEY=`, capture the value.
   - Return the key if found, otherwise return nil.
2. In `SpecGenCommand.run()`, call `getApiKey()` and if nil, print an ANSI-styled error and exit.
3. Provide me the new `Environment.swift` and updated `SpecGenCommand.swift`.
```

**Prompt 5: Networking Layer (OpenAIService)**

```text
Next, let's implement the networking layer to talk to GPT-4o.

1. Create `OpenAIService.swift` in `Sources/specgen/`.
2. Define a struct `OpenAIService` with a stored property `apiKey: String`.
3. Add a function `sendMessage(_ text: String) async throws -> String` that:
   - Constructs a URLRequest for the OpenAI API (fake or real endpoint, but let's be consistent with GPT-4o).
   - Sets the required headers, including `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>`.
   - Uses `URLSession.data(for:request:)` (async/await).
   - Decodes the JSON (create a minimal `Response` struct) to extract the text. 
   - Return that text.
4. Show how you'd handle a failed request with a thrown error. 
5. Provide the code for `OpenAIService.swift`.
```

**Prompt 6: User Interface Helpers**

```text
We want a bit of flair in our console output.

1. Create a new file `ConsoleUI.swift` that has:
   - A function `printColored(_ message: String, colorCode: String)` that wraps the message in ANSI escape codes.
   - A function `printEmoji(_ message: String, emoji: String)` that prints something like "emoji + message".
   - A minimal `Spinner` class or struct that prints a spinner (ASCII-based) overwriting itself every fraction of a second. We can keep it simple—just create placeholders or a conceptual solution for now.

2. Provide the code for `ConsoleUI.swift`.
```

**Prompt 7: Main Interaction Loop**

```text
Now let's create the main loop. We’ll:

1. Print a welcome message in color and with emoji.
2. Prompt the user for their idea with `readLine()`.
3. Send an initial message to GPT-4o: 

   "Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea..."
   
4. Print the response from GPT as a “question” with color or emoji.
5. Prompt the user to answer. 
6. Repeat until the user types `/finish`.

Let's do the following changes in `SpecGenCommand.run()`:
- After we get the API key, initialize an `OpenAIService`.
- Print the welcome banner.
- Prompt for user’s idea.
- Form the initial prompt text that references the user’s idea.
- Enter a loop:
  - Call `openAIService.sendMessage(...)`.
  - Display the question.
  - Let the user type a response. If it’s `/finish`, break out of the loop (we'll handle final spec in the next prompt).
- Show me the updated `SpecGenCommand.swift` that includes this loop. You can pseudo-code some details for spinner usage if needed.
```

**Prompt 8: Final Spec Generation**

```text
Finally, when the user types `/finish`, we send a summarizing prompt:

"Now that we’ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification?"

After we get the response, we:
1. Generate a timestamped file name: `spec-<yyyyMMdd-hhmmss>.md`.
2. Write the text to that file.
3. Print a success message with emojis.
4. Exit the program.

Update `SpecGenCommand.run()` so that after breaking from the main loop:
- We call `openAIService.sendMessage(...)` with the summarizing prompt.
- Write the result to disk.
- Print the success message.
- Exit gracefully.

Show me the final version of `SpecGenCommand.swift` with all integrated logic, ensuring nothing is orphaned.
```

---

**That’s it!** By following these eight code-generation prompts in order, you (and the code-generation LLM) will develop the entire `specgen` application piece by piece, verifying each step.  

You now have a plan broken down into small, iterative chunks, plus the code-generation prompts to guide development. This ensures best practices, incremental progress, and no big jumps in complexity at any stage.
